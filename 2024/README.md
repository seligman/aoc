These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code for 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

The Solutions themselves are in the `Puzzles` folder.  They're meant to be run with the `advent.py` helper.  Run it to see what options it provides, but at a high level, you can run either the `test` or `run` mode to run a day's solution.

Some visualizations for your viewing pleasure:
