These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

For the most part these are Python 3.x scripts.  In each year, you can run `advent.py run 1` to run a day's 
solution and see its output.  On some days where it makes sense, you can also run `advent.py test 1` to run 
through some of the test data.

For 2019 I've uploaded the animated visualizations visualizations created under animations.
