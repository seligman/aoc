<style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 8: Two-Factor Authentication ---</h2><p>You come across a door implementing what you can only assume is an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">two-factor authentication</a> after a long game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement">requirements</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers">telephone</a>.</p>
<p>To get past the door, you first swipe a keycard (no problem; there was one on a nearby desk). Then, it displays a code on a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tiny+lcd&tbm=isch">little screen</a>, and you type that code on a keypad. Then, presumably, the door unlocks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the screen has been <span title="BUT BY WHOM?!">smashed</span>. After a few minutes, you've taken everything apart and figured out how it works. Now you just have to work out what the screen <em>would</em> have displayed.</p>
<p>The magnetic strip on the card you swiped encodes a series of instructions for the screen; these instructions are your puzzle input. The screen is <em><code>50</code> pixels wide and <code>6</code> pixels tall</em>, all of which start <em>off</em>, and is capable of three somewhat peculiar operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rect AxB</code> turns <em>on</em> all of the pixels in a rectangle at the top-left of the screen which is <code>A</code> wide and <code>B</code> tall.</li>
<li><code>rotate row y=A by B</code> shifts all of the pixels in row <code>A</code> (0 is the top row) <em>right</em> by <code>B</code> pixels. Pixels that would fall off the right end appear at the left end of the row.</li>
<li><code>rotate column x=A by B</code> shifts all of the pixels in column <code>A</code> (0 is the left column) <em>down</em> by <code>B</code> pixels. Pixels that would fall off the bottom appear at the top of the column.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here is a simple sequence on a smaller screen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>rect 3x2</code> creates a small rectangle in the top-left corner:</p><pre><code>###....
###....
.......</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>rotate column x=1 by 1</code> rotates the second column down by one pixel:</p><pre><code>#.#....
###....
.#.....</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>rotate row y=0 by 4</code> rotates the top row right by four pixels:</p><pre><code>....#.#
###....
.#.....</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>rotate column x=1 by 1</code> again rotates the second column down by one pixel, causing the bottom pixel to wrap back to the top:</p><pre><code>.#..#.#
#.#....
.#.....</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, this display technology is extremely powerful, and will soon dominate the tiny-code-displaying-screen market.  That's what the advertisement on the back of the display tries to convince you, anyway.</p>
<p>There seems to be an intermediate check of the voltage used by the display: after you swipe your card, if the screen did work, <em>how many pixels should be lit?</em></p>

<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>116</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>You notice that the screen is only capable of displaying capital letters; in the font it uses, each letter is <code>5</code> pixels wide and <code>6</code> tall.</p>
<p>After you swipe your card, <em>what code is the screen trying to display?</em></p>
